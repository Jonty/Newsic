Newsic
======

Newsic digs through your last.fm charts to figure out when you discovered
artists, then presents you with a lovely interactive graph to explore.

The Y axis is the number of plays of newly discovered artists, the X axis is
obviously time. Tooltips pop up with information about the discovered artists
assuming you actually discover some.

Notes
-----

* This is completely untested in anything other than chrome.
* I am a horrid javascript programmer.

Known Problems
--------------
* I can't tell when you bootstrapped to last.fm, so the first few months of
  graph are essentially Newsic getting very excited about music you've been
  listening to for ages. There's nothing I can do about this.
